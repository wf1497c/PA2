When we look up into the sky on a ADJECTIVE summer night, we see millions of tiny spots of light. Each one represents a NOUN which is the center of a ADJECTIVE solar system with NUMBER PLURALNOUN,  revolving ADVERB around a distant star. Sometimes these suns expand and begin to VERB their neighbors. Soon they will become so ADJECTIVE that they will turn into a NOUN. Eventually they subside and become ADJECTIVE giants or perhaps a black NOUN.

Our own planet, which we call NAME, circles around our ADJECTIVE sun NUMBER times every year. There are NUMBER other planets in our solar system. My favorites are called NAME, NAME, and NAME.  A scientist who studies planets is called a NOUN.
